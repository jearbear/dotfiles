# info
These are the dotfiles I have for my laptop. The `bin` directory also contains
some scripts that I use for some quality of life improvements. As you can see from
the screenshot, I'm a big fan of the gruvbox colorscheme. Notable tools that I
use are:

+ **termite** as my terminal emulator
+ **zsh** as my shell
+ **neovim** as my text editor
+ **bspwm** as my window manager
+ **sxhkd** to manage key bindings
+ **pass** to manage and store passwords
+ **rofi** as my launcher
+ **polybar** as my status bar
