### installation

You'll need to clone this repo to some directory that is **not** `$HOME`, I like to use `.dotfiles`. The files are structured in the same manner as they would sit in your `$HOME` directory without the typical `.` prefix, just to make them slightly easier to navigate. These have only been really tested with Arch Linux, though there may be some macOS stuff here and there for work.

To manage my dotfiles I use a small tool I wrote called [dots](https://github.com/jearbear/dots). It handles linking files from `.dotfiles` to their target in the `$HOME` directory and a few other things. Tools like [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) or [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) should work just fine though!
