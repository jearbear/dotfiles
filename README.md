### installation

You'll need to clone this repo to some directory that is **not** `$HOME`, I like to use `.dotfiles`. The files are structured in the same manner as they would sit in your `$HOME` directory without the typical `.` prefix, just to make them slightly easier to navigate. I've somewhat tested these with both OSX and Arch Linux, but only some of these dotfiles are relevant in OSX.

I use a _very_ small helper script, `dotit` to link files to their respective locations. Hopefully I'll expand its capabilities in the future, but for now it just links files:

`dotit add $FILE`


### todo

- expand capabilities of `dotit`
- common `bin` scripts I use
- generalize to support 4K resolution
